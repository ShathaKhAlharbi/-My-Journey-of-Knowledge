# 🌍 My Journey of Knowledge

Hello everyone 👋  

This repository serves as a **comprehensive and structured roadmap** documenting my journey to master **Computer Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, and Robotics**.  
My ultimate goal is to build a **solid, well-connected foundation** — one that fills the gaps that can naturally appear in self-paced learning.  
This repository evolves as I do, continuously updated with new skills, discoveries, and milestones.

## 🌠 Vision

> *"Knowledge is not memorized — it’s constructed, layer by layer, until it becomes understanding."*

My mission is to build **deep, interconnected knowledge** — uniting computer engineering, robotics, signal analysis, artificial intelligence, and embedded systems into one cohesive skillset.  
To create technology that’s **intelligent, efficient, and ethical** — built on solid principles, not shortcuts.

This journey is not a race; it’s a deliberate evolution — step by step, concept by concept — toward mastering both the **science** and the **philosophy** of intelligence.
